<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Mudit Gupta, a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering student at Amity University, Noida. 
  With a current CGPA of 8.7, I have consistently demonstrated academic excellence, backed by a 50% merit scholarship 
  for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>I have a strong foundation in programming, including proficiency in C, C++, Python, and knowledge of Data Structures 
  and Algorithms (up to linked lists). My curiosity has led me to explore Android development basics and begin my journey 
  into web development.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I lead as the team head of the Code Campers Club, fostering innovation and collaboration among peers.
  A zone-level basketball player, I thrive on teamwork and discipline, both on and off the court.</p>

<p>I enjoy diving into creative challenges, and I have honed my public speaking skills at Gurukul Drona, Ludhiana, making me 
  confident in articulating ideas effectively.</p>

<p>My portfolio reflects my commitment to growth and versatilityâ€”qualities that define me as a quick learner, a dedicated individual,
  and someone ready to make a meaningful impact in the tech world.</p>
